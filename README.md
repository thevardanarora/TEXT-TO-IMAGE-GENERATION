# TEXT-TO-IMAGE-GENERATION

# •	USING ML– transformers, gradio, diffusers
# •	Developed a text-to-image generator using Segmind's SSD-1B model with 99.9% memory-efficient attention on GPU.
# •	Built a Gradio interface to input prompts and generate images, achieving <5 seconds response time.
# •	Integrated torch float16 precision to optimize performance, reducing memory usage by 50% for larger prompts.
